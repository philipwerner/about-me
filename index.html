    <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <h3>Growing Up</h3>

          <p>I am a product of the early 80's and have broken bones and stories that go with that. My father was in the US Air Force so we moved around on a regular basis. We eventually laid roots in Warsaw, IN, where I graduated high school. I then went to Ball State University for brief time focusing on Journalism. I later attended a smaller Community College for the same thing with an emphasis on design where I learned about typography and digital editing.</p>

        <h3>Life in the US Army</h3>

          <p>On somewhat of a whim I joined the US Army and became an Airborne Infantryman. I was stationed at Ft. Bragg in North Carolina with the 82nd Airborne and then quickly went on my first combat deployment. Several more followed while remaining stationed there. In that time I went to several schools (Sniper School, Ranger School, Jumpmaster School) and quickly moved up in rank. In late 2010 I was stationed at Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington. While at JBLM I attended Pathfinder school and was promoted to Staff Sergant. I then deployed with my unit to Afghanistan in late 2011 and returned home in mid 2012. I completed my time in the Army at the end of July that year.</p>

      <h2>Post Army Life</h2>

        <h3>The Railroad</h3>

          <p>After leaving the Army I went to work for BNSF Railway in Southern California. I started work as a entry level Mechanical Foreman at a locomotive maintenance facility. It was very intimidating due to the fact I knew practicaly nothing about locomotives or the railroad. I spent about 16 hours a day bringing myself up to speed on the many different types of locomotives and their parts. I would spend a good part of my day with the machinists and electricians helping them with whatever task they were assigned to that day and getting to know them.</p>

          <p> After about 2 years I was promoted to Assistant General Foreman and took complete control of one of the shops and was responsible for 45 employees. A year later I was recomended and recieved a rapid responder supervisor job. This job gave me an additional 6 employees that would go with me to derailments or other incidents involving or locomotives in Southern California.</p>

        <h3>From Rails To Water</h3>

          <p>After getting burnt out on many years of being a boss, I decided I needed a change. I had always loved woodworking and decided to find something where I could use that love. I stumbled upon an oppurtunity to work as a shipwright and went with it. The work was very enjoyable, both physically and mentally exhausting. Every boat would bring its own problems and challenges. It was very satisfying to start the day with a rough piece of lumber and end with it as a beautiful plank on a boat that would start vertical and end horizontal. Unfortunately my body could not handle the work anymore, I am just a bit to tall to work on boats and my knees couldn't take the bending anymore.</P>
